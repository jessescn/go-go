## Summary

- Boolean type
  - Values are true or false
  - Not an alias for other types (e.g. int)
  - Zero value is false
  - Non initialize values are zero
- Numeric Types
  - Integers
    - Signed integers
      - int type has varying size, but min 32 bits
      - 8 bit (int8) through 64 bit (int64)
    - Unsigned integers
      - 8 bit (byte and uint8) through 32 bit (uint32)
    - Arithmetic operations
      - Addition, substraction, multiplication, division, remainder
    - Bitwise operations
      - And, or, xor and not
    - Zero value is 0
    - Can't mix types in same family (uint32 + uint16 = error)
  - Floating point numbers
    - 32 and 64 bit versions
    - Literal types
      - Decimal (3.14)
      - Exponential (10e16)
      - Mixed (13.7e12)
    - Arithmetic operations
      - Addition, substraction, multiplication, division
  - Complex Numbers
    - Zero value is (0 + 0i)
    - 64 and 128 bit versions
    - Built-in functions
      - complex - make complex number from two floats
      - real - get real part as float
      - imag - get imaginary part as float
    - Arithmetic operations
      - Addition, substraction, multiplication, division
  - Text Types
    - Strings
      - UTF-8
      - Immutable
      - Can be concatenated with (+) operator
      - Can be converted to []byte
    - Rune
      - UTF-32
      - Alias for int32
      - Special methods normally requires to process
